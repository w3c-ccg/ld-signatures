      <p>
This specification describes a mechanism for ensuring the authenticity and
integrity of Linked Data documents using digital signatures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The term Linked Data is used to describe a recommended best practice for
exposing, sharing, and connecting information on the Web using standards,
such as URLs, to identify things and their properties. When information
is presented as Linked Data, other related information can be easily discovered
and new information can be easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a
decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale integration.

With the increase in usage of Linked Data for a variety of applications, there
is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data
documents. This specification adds authentication and integrity protection to
linked data documents through the use of public/private key cryptography
without sacrificing Linked Data features such as extensibility and
composability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

      <p>
The Linked Data Signature specification achieves the following design goals:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Simple for Developers</dt>
        <dd>
The signature format is designed to be easy to use for developers that don't
have significant cryptography training. For example, <a>signature suite</a>
identifiers are used instead of specific cryptographic parameters to ensure that
it is difficult to accidentally produce a weak digital signature.
        </dd>

        <dt>Syntax Agnostic</dt>
        <dd>
The signature mechanism can be used across a variety of RDF data syntaxes such
as JSON-LD, N-Quads, and TURTLE, without the need to regenerate the signature.
        </dd>
        <dt>Agile</dt>
        <dd>
Since digital signature suites may be compromised without warning due to
technological advancements, it is important that suites can be easily and
quickly replaced. This specification provides algorithm agility while still
keeping the digital signature format easy for developers to understand.
        </dd>
        <dt>Extensible</dt>
        <dd>
Creating and deploying new signature suites is a fairly trivial undertaking
to ensure that the signature format increases the rate of innovation in the
digital signature space.
        </dd>

      </dl>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of Linked Data digital signatures.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>linked data document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A document comprised of Linked Data.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signed linked data document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A <a>linked data document</a> that has been digitally signed.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>linked data signature</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A set of attributes that represent a Linked Data digital signature and
the parameters required to verify it.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature options</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A set of options that is included in the signature data. These options may
be a <a>domain</a>, <a>nonce</a>, or other data that is specific to the
signature format.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>public key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A cryptographic key that can be used to verify digital signatures created
with a corresponding <a>private key</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>private key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A cryptographic key that can be used to generate digital signatures.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A string value that specifies the operational domain of a digital signature.
This may be an Internet domain name like <code>example.com</code>, a
ad-hoc value such as <code>mycorp-level3-access</code>, or a very
specific transaction value like <code>8zF6T$mqP</code>. A signer may
include a <a>domain</a> in its digital signature to restrict its use
to particular target, identified by the specified <a>domain</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a deterministic representation.
For example, alphabetically sorting a list of items is a type canonicalization.
This process is sometimes also called <em>normalization</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Linked Data Signature Overview</h2>

      <p>
A <a>linked data signature</a> is a type of [[!LD-PROOF]], and is comprised of
information about the signature, parameters required to verify it, and the
signature value itself. All of this information is provided using Linked Data
vocabularies such as the [[!SECURITY-VOCABULARY]].
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>linked data signature</a> typically includes at least the
        following attributes:
      </p>

      <dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
        <dt>type (required)<dt>
        <dd>
A URI that identifies the digital <a>signature suite</a> that was used to create the
signature. For example: <code>Ed25519Signature2018</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn>created</dfn> (required)<dt>
        <dd>
The string value of an [[!ISO8601]] combined date and time string generated
by the <a href="#signature-algorithm">Signature Algorithm</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>domain (optional)<dt>
        <dd>
A string value specifying the restricted <a>domain</a> of the signature.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>nonce</dfn> (optional, but strongly recommended)<dt>
        <dd>
A string value that is included in the digital signature and MUST only be
used once for a particular <a>domain</a> and window of time. This
value is used to mitigate replay attacks.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature value</dfn> (required)<dt>
        <dd>
One of any number of valid representations of <em>signature value</em>
generated by the <a href="#signature-algorithm">Signature Algorithm</a>.
Example: <code>jws</code> for detached JSON Web Signatures.
</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="note">
Since this specification is based on Linked Data, the terms <code>type</code>,
<code>created</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>nonce</code>, and
<code>jws</code> above map to URLs. The vocabulary where these terms are defined
is the [[SECURITY-VOCABULARY]].
      </p>

      <p>
A signature can be added to a Linked Data document like the following:
      </p>

      <pre class="example highlight" title="A simple Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!"
}
      </pre>

      <p>
by adding the parameters outlined in this section:
      </p>

      <pre class="example highlight" title="A simple signed Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!",
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "created": "2019-08-23T20:21:34Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:123456#key1",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  }
}
      </pre>

      <p>
The signature example above uses the <code>Ed25519Signature2018</code>
<a>signature suite</a> to produce a verifiable digital signature.
      </p>

<div class="issue">Create a separate section detailing an optional mechanism
for authenticating public key control via bi-directional links. How
to establish trust in key controller entities is out of scope but examples can
be given.</div>

<div class="issue">Specify algorithm agility mechanisms (additional attributes
from the security vocab can be used to indicate other signing and hash
algorithms). Rewrite algorithms to be parameterized on this basis and
move `RsaSignature2018` definition to a single supported
mechanism; specify its identifier as a URL. In order to make it easy to
specify a variety of combinations of algorithms, introduce a core
type `LinkedDataSignature` that allows for easy filtering/discover of
signature nodes, but that type on its own doesn't specify any default
signature or hash algorithms, those must be given via other properties in the
nodes.</div>

<div class="issue">Add a note indicating that this specification should not
be construed to indicate that public key owners should be restricted to a
single public key or that systems that use this spec and involve real people
should identify each person as only ever being a single entity rather than
perhaps N entities with M keys. There are no such restrictions and in many
cases those kinds of restrictions are ill-advised due to privacy
considerations.</div>

<div class="issue">Add an explicit check on key type to prevent an
attacker from selecting an algorithm that may abuse how the key is
used/interpreted.</div>

<div class="issue">Add a note indicating that selective disclosure signature
mechanisms can be compatible with Linked Data Signatures; for example,
an algorithm could produce a merkle tree from a canonicalized set of
N-Quads and then sign the root hash. Disclosure would involve including
the merkle paths for each N-Quad that is to be revealed. This mechanism
would merely consume the normalized output differently (this, and the
proof mechanism would be modifications to this core spec). It may also
be necessary to generate signature parameters such as a private key/seed
that can be used along with an algorithm to deterministically generate
nonces that are concatenated with each N-Quad to prevent rainbow
table or similar attacks.</div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Multiple Signatures</h2>
      <p>
The Linked Data Signatures specification supports the concept of multiple
signatures in a single document. There are two types of multi-signature
approaches that are identified: Signature Sets and Signature Chains.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature Sets</h3>
        <p>
A signature set is useful when the same data needs to be signed by multiple
entities, but where the order of signatures does not matter,
such as in the case of a set of signatures on a contract. A signature set,
which has no order, is represented by associating a set of signatures
with the <code>signature</code> key in a document.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" title="A signature set in a Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!",
  "proof": [{
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "created": "2019-08-23T20:21:34Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:123456#key1",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  },
  {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "created": "2017-09-23T20:21:34Z",
    "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/i/pat/keys/5",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  }]
}
        </pre>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature Chains</h3>
        <p>
A signature chain is useful when the same data needs to be signed by
multiple entities and the order of when the signatures occurred matters,
such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a signature that had been
created on a document. A signature chain, where order must be preserved, is
represented by associating an ordered list of signatures with the
<code>signatureChain</code> key in a document.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" title="A signature chain in a Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!",
  "proofChain": [{
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "created": "2019-08-23T20:21:34Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:123456#key1",

    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  },
  {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",

    "jws": "eyJ0eXAiOiJK...gFWFOEjXk"
  }]
}

      <h2>Signature Suites</h2>

      <p>
A Linked Data Signature is designed to be easy to use by developers and
therefore strives to minimize the amount of information one has to remember
to generate a signature. Often, just the <a>signature suite</a> name (e.g.
<code>Ed25519Signature2018</code>) is required
from developers to initiate the creation of a signature. These signature
suites are often created or reviewed by people that have the requisite
cryptographic training to ensure that safe combinations of cryptographic
primitives are used.
      </p>
      <p>
This section details the cryptographic primitives that are available to
<a>signature suite</a> developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a minimum, a <a>signature suite</a> must have the
        following attributes:
      </p>

      <dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
        <dt>id</dt>
        <dd>
A URL that identifies the <a>signature suite</a>.
For example: <code>https://w3id.org/security/v1#Ed25519Signature2018</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>type</dt>
        <dd>
The value <code>SignatureSuite</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>canonicalizationAlgorithm</dt>
        <dd>
A URL that identifies the <a>canonicalization algorithm</a> to use on the
<var>document</var>. For example:
<code>https://w3id.org/security#URDNA2015</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>digestAlgorithm</dt>
        <dd>
A URL that identifies the <a>message digest algorithm</a> to use on the
<var>canonicalized document</var>. For example:
<code>http://w3id.org/digests#sha512</code>
        </dd>
        <dt>signatureAlgorithm</dt>
        <dd>
A URL that identifies the <a>signature algorithm</a> to use on the
<var>data to be signed</var>. For example:
<code>http://w3id.org/security#ed25519</code>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
A complete example of a <a>signature suite</a> is shown in the next example:

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The algorithms defined below are generalized in that they require a specific
<a>canonicalization algorithm</a>, <a>message digest algorithm</a>, and
<a>signature algorithm</a> to be used to achieve the algorithm's intended
outcome.

        <h3>Signature Algorithm</h3>

<div class="issue">The signature parameters should be included as headers
and values in the data to be signed.</div>

        <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to create a digital signature that can
be later used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a
<a>linked data document</a>. A <a>linked data document</a>,
<var>document</var>, <a>signature options</a>, <var>options</var>,
and a <a>private key</a>, <var>privateKey</var>, are required inputs.
The <a>signature options</a> MUST contain an identifier for the
public/private key pair, and an ISO8601 combined date and
time string, <var>created</var>, containing the current date and time,
accurate to at least one second, in Universal Time Code format. A <a>nonce</a>
and a <a>domain</a> may also be specified in the <var>options</var>. A
<a>signed linked data document</a> is produced as output. Whenever this
algorithm encodes strings, it MUST use UTF-8 encoding.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Create a copy of <var>document</var>, hereafter referred to as <var>output</var>.

          <li>
Generate a <var>canonicalized document</var> by canonicalizing
<var>document</var> according to a <a>canonicalization algorithm</a>
(e.g. the <em>URDNA2015</em> [[!RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] algorithm).
        </li>
          <li>
Create a value <var>tbs</var> that represents the data to be signed, and
set it to the result of running the

          <li>
Digitally sign <var>tbs</var> using the <var>privateKey</var> and the
the <var>digital signature algorithm</var> (e.g. JSON Web Signature using
<em>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</em> algorithm). The resulting string is the

Add a <code>signature</code> node to <var>output</var> containing
a <a>linked data signature</a> using the appropriate
<var>type</var> and <a>signatureValue</a> values as well as
all of the data in the <var>signature options</var> (e.g.
<var>created</var>, and if given, any additional signature
options such as <a>nonce</a> and <a>domain</a>).

        <h3>Signature Verification Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to check the authenticity and
integrity of a <a>signed linked data document</a> by verifying its
digital signature. This algorithm takes a
<a>signed linked data document</a>, <var>signed document</var> and
outputs a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value based on whether or
not the digital signature on <var>signed document</var> was verified. Whenever
this algorithm encodes strings, it MUST use UTF-8 encoding.

<div class="issue">Specify how the public key can be obtained (through
some out-of-band process and passed in or it can be retrieved by
derefencing its URL identifier, etc.</div>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Get the <a>public key</a> by dereferencing its URL identifier in
the <code>signature</code> node of the default graph of
<var>signed document</var>. Confirm that the <a>linked data document</a>
that describes the <a>public key</a> specifies its owner and that its
owner's URL identifier can be dereferenced to reveal a bi-directional link back
to the key. Ensure that the key's owner is a trusted entity before proceeding
to the next step.
          </li>
          <li>
Let <var>document</var> be a copy of <var>signed document</var>.

Remove any <code>signature</code> nodes from the default graph in
<var>document</var> and save it as <var>signature</var>.

          <li>
Generate a <var>canonicalized document</var> by canonicalizing
<var>document</var> according to the <a>canonicalization algorithm</a>
(e.g. the </var><em>URDNA2015</em> [[!RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] algorithm).
          </li>
          <li>
Create a value <var>tbv</var> that represents the data to be verified, and
set it to the result of running the
<a href="#create-verify-hash-algorithm">Create Verify Hash Algorithm</a>,
passing the information in <var>signature</var>.

          <li>

and the <a>public key</a> to the <a>signature algorithm</a>
(e.g. JSON Web Signature using <em>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</em> algorithm).
Return the resulting boolean value.

        <h3>Create Verify Hash Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to create the data that is used
to generate or verify a digital signature. It takes a canonicalized
<a>linked data document</a>, <var>canonicalized document</var>,
<a>canonicalization algorithm</a>, a <a>message digest algorithm</a>, and
<a>signature options</a>, <var>input options</var> (by reference).
The <a>signature options</a> MUST contain an identifier for the
public/private key pair, and an ISO8601 combined date and
time string, <var>created</var>, containing the current date and time,
accurate to at least one second, in Universal Time Code format. A <a>nonce</a>
and a <a>domain</a> may also be specified in the <var>options</var>.
Its output is a data that can be used to generate or verify a
digital signature (it is usually further hashed as part of the
verification or signing process).
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Let <var>options</var> be a copy of <var>input options</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
If <code>type</code>, <code>id</code>, or <code>signatureValue</code>
exists in <var>options</var>, remove the entry.
          </li>
          <li>
If <var>created</var> does not exist in <var>options</var>, add an
entry with a value that is an ISO8601 combined date and
time string containing the current date and time accurate to at least one
second, in Universal Time Code format. For example:
<code>2017-11-13T20:21:34Z</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
Generate <var>output</var> by:

              <li>
Creating a <var>canonicalized options document</var> by canonicalizing
<var>options</var> according to the <a>canonicalization algorithm</a>
(e.g. the <em>URDNA2015</em> [[!RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] algorithm).
              </li>
              <li>
Hash <var>canonicalized options document</var> using the

<div class="issue">This last step needs further clarification. Signing
implementations usually automatically perform their own integrated
hashing of an input message, i.e. signing algorithms are a combination
of a raw signing mechanism and a hashing mechanism such as
RS256 (RSA + SHA-256). Current implementations of RSA-based
Linked Data Signature suites therefore do not perform this last step
before passing the data to a signing algorithm as it will be performed
internally. The Ed25519Signature2018 algorithm also does not perform
this last step -- and, in fact, uses SHA-512 internally. In short,
this last step should better communicate that the 64 bytes produced
from concatenating the SHA-256 of the canonicalized options with the
SHA-256 of the canonicalized document are passed into the signing
algorithm with a presumption that the signing algorithm will include
hashing of its own.</div>
Note: It is presumed that the 64-byte <var>output</var> will be used
in a signing algorithm that includes its own hashing algorithm, such
as RS256 (RSA + SHA-256) or EdDsa (Ed25519 which uses SHA-512).
          </li>
